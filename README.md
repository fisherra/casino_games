# Casino Games in R

## Roll The Dice 

A blog post based on relative frequency calculations, functions, and for loops. This post was losely created to suppliment my Master's course 'Probability Theory' and another book I'm reading, 'Probability with R'.

## Roulette 

A longer analysis and my first attempt at a simulation. This blog post was completely self guided and not supplimental to any resource.

## Slots 

Strictly based on the third project in 'Hands on Programming with R' by Garrett Grolemund.
