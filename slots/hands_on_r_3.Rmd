# chapter 9 - loops 

loops are R's method for repeating tasks. 
which makes them great for simulations. 

Expected Values - 
E(x) = sum(x * f(x))

```{r}
wheel <- c("DD", "7", "BBB", "BB", "B", "C", "0")

combos <- expand.grid(wheel, wheel, wheel, stringsAsFactors = F)

combos <- as_tibble(combos)

combos
```

get probability of each outcome
```{r}
prob <- c("DD" = 0.03, "7" = 0.03, "BBB" = 0.06, "BB" = 0.1, "B" = 0.25, "C" = 0.01, "0" = 0.52)

prob
```

```{r}
combos$prob1 <- prob[combos$Var1]
combos$prob2 <- prob[combos$Var2]
combos$prob3 <- prob[combos$Var3]

combos
```

total probabilities 
```{r}
combos$prob_total <- combos$prob1 * combos$prob2 * combos$prob3

combos
```

sums to 1?
```{r}
sum(combos$prob_total)
```

and now calculate the payouts for each combination to find expected value 
```{r}
score <- function(symbols) {
  
  # check if all symbols are the same
  same <- length(unique(symbols)) == 1
  # check if all symbols are variety of bar
  bars <- all(symbols %in% c('B', 'BB', 'BBB'))
  
  # if all symbols are the same
  if (same) {
  # assign payout value in 'lookup table'
    payouts <- c('DD' = 100, '7' = 80, 'BBB' = 40, 'BB' = 25, 'B' = 10, 'C' = 10, '0' = 0)
    prize <- payouts[[symbols[1]]] 
  # if all symbols are bars
  } else if (all(bars)) {
  # prize is $5
    prize <- 5
  # else check for cherries
  } else {
  # count cherries
    cherries <- sum(symbols == "C")
  # assign prize based on cherry
    prize <- c(0,2,5)[cherries + 1]
  }
  
  # now check if any diamonds are present
  diamonds <- sum(symbols == "DD")
  # adjust prize as necissary 
  prize <- prize * (2 ^ diamonds)

}


```


```{r}
symbols <- c(combos[[1,1]], combos[[1,2]], combos[[1,3]])

symbols[[1]]
print(score(symbols))
```


however there are 343 rows, we need a for loop 

empty vector
```{r}
combos$prize <- NA

combos
```

for loop time 
```{r}
for (i in 1:nrow(combos)) {

symbols <- c(combos[[i,1]], combos[[i,2]], combos[[i,3]])

combos$prize[i] <- score(symbols)

}

combos

```
